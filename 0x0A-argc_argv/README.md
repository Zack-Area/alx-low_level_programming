# 0x0A. C - argc, argv

The purpose of this `README.md` file is to provide instructions and explanations for three different programming topics: how to use arguments passed to your program, the two prototypes of `main` function, and how to use `attribute((unused))` or `(void)` to compile functions with unused variables or parameters.
