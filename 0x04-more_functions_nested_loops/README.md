# 0x04. C - More functions, more nested loops
The purpose of this `README.md` file is to share my experience and what I learned while solving some programming tasks. During the tasks, I gained an understanding of nested loops, how to use them, and why they are useful. I also learned about functions, their purpose, and how to create and use them in programs. I gained a deeper understanding of the difference between a declaration and a definition of a function and the importance of prototypes. Additionally, I learned about the scope of variables and how it affects their usage in programs. The tasks also taught me about the `gcc flags -Wall -Werror -pedantic -Wextra -std=gnu89`, their purpose, and how to use them effectively. Lastly, I learned about header files and how to use them with `#include` to facilitate program organization and code reuse.
