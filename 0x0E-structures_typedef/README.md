# 0x0E. C - Structures, typedef
The purpose of this `README.md` file is to learn about structures and how I can use them to group related data together in C programming, as well as when and why I might want to use them. Additionally, I learned about `typedef` and how it can be used to create custom data types for more readable and maintainable code.
