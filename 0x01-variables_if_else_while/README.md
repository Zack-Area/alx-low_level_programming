# 0x01. C - Variables, if, else, while

The purpose of this README.md file is to provide an overview of the essential topics covered in this project. Throughout the project, I learned about a variety of operators, including arithmetic, logical (also known as boolean), and relational operators, and how to use them in C. I gained an understanding of the values that are considered TRUE and FALSE in C, as well as how to use boolean operators effectively.

In addition to learning about operators, I also explored conditional statements such as if and `if`...`else`, as well as how to use comments in my code. I learned how to declare variables of types `char`, `int`, and `unsigned int`, and assign values to them. Furthermore, I discovered how to print the values of these variables using `printf`.

As I delved deeper into the project, I also learned how to use the `while` loop and variables with the while loop. I gained an understanding of how to print variables using `printf`, as well as the ASCII character set.
