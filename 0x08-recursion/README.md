# 0x08. C - Recursion

The purpose of this `README` file is to share what I learned about recursion, its implementation, and when to use it or avoid it. Recursion is a technique in computer science where a function calls itself until a base condition is met. I learned that recursion is useful when solving problems that can be divided into smaller sub-problems that can be solved using the same logic. Implementing recursion involves defining the base case, which is the condition that stops the function from calling itself, and the recursive case, which is the condition that triggers the function to call itself. However, recursion can lead to performance issues if the recursion depth is too large, or if the same sub-problems are being solved repeatedly. Therefore, it is essential to understand the problem and the data structures involved before deciding whether to implement recursion. In some cases, using loops or other iterative techniques may be more efficient and less prone to errors than recursion.
