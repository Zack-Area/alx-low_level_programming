# 0x09. C - Static libraries

The purpose of this `README.md` file is to discuss the tasks I completed and what I learned from them. The main objective of these tasks was to gain a deeper understanding of static libraries, including what they are, how they work, and how to create and use them. Through these exercises, I learned how to create a static library using the `ar` utility, how to use the `ranlib` utility to update the library's index, and how to use the `nm` command to list the symbols defined in the library. I also learned about the benefits of using static libraries in software development, such as improved performance and reduced dependency issues.
