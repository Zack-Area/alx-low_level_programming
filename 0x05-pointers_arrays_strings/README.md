# 0x05. C - Pointers, arrays and strings

Through the completion of the tasks focused on pointers, arrays, strings, I have gained a deeper understanding of these fundamental concepts in programming. I now understand that pointers are variables that store memory addresses, allowing us to access and manipulate data directly in memory. Arrays are collections of elements of the same type, which can be accessed using index notation. I also learned that while pointers and arrays share some similarities, they have distinct differences in terms of their behavior and use cases.
