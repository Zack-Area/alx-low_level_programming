# 0x0D. C - Preprocessor
The purpose of this `README.md` file is to explain three fundamental concepts in C programming: *macros*, *predefined macros*, and *include guards*. Macros are preprocessor directives that allow you to define constants, perform inline function-like substitutions, and conditionally compile code. Using macros can make your code more efficient and easier to read. Predefined macros are macros that are defined by the compiler or operating system and can be used in your code without having to define them yourself. Some of the most common predefined macros include `FILE`, `LINE`, and `DATE`. Finally, include guards are used to prevent multiple inclusions of a header file in a single translation unit. By defining include guards, you can ensure that your code compiles correctly and avoid errors that can occur when a header file is included multiple times in the same source file.
