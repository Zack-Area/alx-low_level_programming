# 0x15. C - File I/O

The purpose of those tasks is to provide a comprehensive understanding of how to work with files in a Unix-like operating system. Files are a fundamental concept in Unix-like systems, and knowing how to create, open, close, read, and write files is essential for any programmer or system administrator. In Unix-like systems, file I/O is done through file descriptors, which are integer values that represent an open file. There are three standard file descriptors, namely `STDIN`, `STDOUT`, and `STDERR`, each with its purpose and `POSIX` names. The I/O system calls open, close, read, and write are used to perform file operations, and they take file descriptors as arguments. The flags `O_RDONLY`, `O_WRONLY`, and `O_RDWR` are used to specify the file access mode when using the `open` system call. File permissions are used to control who can access a file and what operations they can perform on it. When creating a file with the open system call, file permissions can be set using a combination of the mode argument and the bitwise OR operator. A system call is a low-level function provided by the operating system that can be used to interact with the system's resources, such as files, devices, and network sockets. The main difference between a function and a system call is that a function is a high-level programming construct that is executed in the program's address space, while a system call is executed in the operating system's address space, with the help of the kernel.
